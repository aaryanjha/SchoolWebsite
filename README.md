# ScoolWebsite
This is my 1st try in making a full stack website (this is incomplete version, the changes will be commited as soon it is completed)
#
This repository just contains only the html and css section, later on more will be added.
#
I have used the TAILWIND css framework and used a few templates from git and image sources from unsplash to complete this.
#
All credits for this webpage ideas goes to you tube channel code with harry, from whose videos I got to know about the TAILWIND framework and I started working on making this website.
Thanks to google for providing amazing school quotes and images.
